# db2admintool
Open source monitoring and administration tool for IBM Db2.

## About
The project goal is an open source set of easy-to-use monitoring and housekeeping tools for IBM Db2. This will focus on Linux, Unix and Windows (LUW) initially, but may expand in future to encompasss Db2 for z/OS (i.e. as I learn more about that) and possibly other databases.

## Status
The project is in its infancy and in active development.
